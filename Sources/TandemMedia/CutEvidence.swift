/// `tandem check --cuts --listen`: what the levels, the transcript's rules
/// and listening say together about one join.
///
/// Each on its own over-flags. On Mike's published Tandem video `check
/// --cuts --listen` flagged 38 of 257 joins, and reading each one again
/// found 4 real. The levels flagged tight joins in fluent speech, where the
/// voice runs straight through the cut and every word is heard whole. The
/// last-word rule flagged a word the engine then heard ("stuff like that."),
/// so the transcript's times were off, not the cut. And most of what
/// listening flagged as a word left in was a word the take's transcript has
/// just past the edge, heard whole ("my own", "hopefully see"): the
/// transcript put it in the cut, but the cut keeps it.
///
/// So where a join was heard, each side checks the other:
/// - a level flag, or a transcript rule's flag, whose words are heard whole
///   and in place is dismissed, unless listening has a finding there too;
/// - a listening finding the take's own transcript explains is a note;
/// - a join with both stays a problem, with both said.
///
/// Levels win where the sound itself says the cut is inside a word: the
/// clip's last or first 25 ms under `heardOver` dB below the speech. On the
/// Ian video four joins Mike heard clipped (a fluent join or a cut inside a
/// word) were all at 4.7 dB or less, and the engine heard every word of
/// them, filling in what was cut. The Tandem video's tight joins in fluent
/// speech were mostly 6 dB or more under.
